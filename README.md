The gaming room client wanted a software developed to host their game draw it or lose it on multiple OS.
What was done particularly well for this assignment was developing a running and working code.
When working at the design document I found looking and considering the design constraints along with the requirements to be the most helpful.
The one thing I would do more work on are the design requirements themselves, since I think I could have worded them better.
I tried my best to follow what was requested and find ways to implement said features within the design constraints.
In the future I believe I would like to run more tests on software to make sure it works within the specified requirements for certain.
